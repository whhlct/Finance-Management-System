# Finance-Management-System
Vision:
We will create a digital ledger for transactions made on different budget accounts. We will also
create functions for tracking of individual budgets and analytics. We will also create a system for
automating reimbursements through venmo, zelle, etc. This system will automate much of the
job for a treasurer, as they will no longer need to manually update budgets by adding
transactions to a spreadsheet.

Stack:

  ● ReactJS for frontend
  
  ● Golang + Python for backend

Goals:
  1. Make an easy to use and interactive frontend for the app
  2. Create budget management system that allocates budget and keeps track of current
  total
  3. Create an automated reimbursement system that updates the budget and reimburses
  members who need it

Milestones:

  Milestones for January:
  
    ● Determine team members and roles
    ● Determine site map
 
  Milestone for February
  
    ● Create design wireframes for websites
    ● Determine what backend functions and apis we want to use
    ● Design and construct database for keeping track of data
    ● Create basic prototype for transaction tracking
  
  Milestone for March
  
    ● Implement frontend design and functions and start connecting with backend
    ● Continue working on backend functions
    ● Create automatic reimbursement capabilities through financial vendors (venmo,
    zelle)
  Milestone for April
   
    ● Finish connecting frontend with backend
    ● Make sure that the app is hosted
    ● Create event planning and categorization of charges to specific events
