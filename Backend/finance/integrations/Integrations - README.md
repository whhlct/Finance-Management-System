# Digital Payment Services Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the integration code for Cash App and Venmo payment services. Please note that the Zelle integration is defunct as Zelle no longer supports its own standalone app.

## Cash App Integration

The Cash App integration uses a REST API client that authenticates with OAuth 2.0 and makes signed API requests. It provides functionality for checking account balance, sending and requesting payments, and retrieving transaction history.

### Key Features

- OAuth 2.0 authentication with access token management
- HMAC request signing for security
- Comprehensive logging
- Functions for:
  - Getting account balance
  - Viewing transaction history
  - Sending payments
  - Requesting payments
  - Checking payment status
  - Viewing customer profiles

### Implementation Details

The `CashAppClient` class manages all interactions with the Cash App API. It handles authentication tokens automatically, refreshing them when expired. All API requests include proper signatures generated using HMAC-SHA256 to ensure request authenticity.

The client provides methods for common operations and logs all transactions to a dedicated log file for audit purposes. It supports both sandbox and production environments for testing and live deployments.

## Venmo Integration

The Venmo integration uses Selenium WebDriver to automate browser interactions, providing functionality for account access, payments, requests, and profile management.

### Key Features

- Headless browser automation
- Page object design pattern
- Retry mechanism for handling flaky web operations
- Comprehensive logging
- Command-line interface
- Functions for:
  - Account login/logout
  - Checking account balance
  - Viewing transaction history
  - Viewing and updating profile
  - Sending payments
  - Requesting payments

### Implementation Details

The integration uses a page object model pattern to organize browser automation code. Each page on the Venmo website has a corresponding class that encapsulates the functionality of that page.

The `VenmoService` orchestrator class ties these page objects together and provides high-level methods. A retry decorator is implemented to handle intermittent failures in web automation, making the integration more robust.

The command-line interface provides a convenient way to execute common operations without writing additional code.

## Zelle Integration (Defunct)

The Zelle integration code is no longer functional as Zelle no longer supports its own standalone app. Zelle services are now integrated directly into banking applications.

The included `ZelleService` class contains methods for operations that are no longer supported:
- Sending payments
- Retrieving payment details
- Requesting money
- Credential management

This code is kept for reference but should not be used in production systems.

## Security Considerations

1. **API Credentials**: Store all API keys, client IDs, and secrets in environment variables or a secure credential store.

2. **Logging**: Both integrations implement comprehensive logging but ensure sensitive information is not logged.

3. **Sandbox Testing**: Use sandbox/test environments when available before using production credentials.

4. **Data Handling**: Process and store transaction data according to relevant financial data regulations.

5. **Authentication**: Keep authentication tokens secure and implement proper token refresh mechanisms.

## Error Handling

Both integrations implement error handling strategies:

- Cash App uses exception handling with detailed error messages
- Venmo uses a retry decorator to handle intermittent failures
- Both use comprehensive logging to track issues
